## Terraform a journey for managing creation of resources
So, lets say i want to deploy a web app on a virtual instance that requires a SQL storage (Azure SQL) so you will go to the azure portal create the resources link add the storage account and cnnection string to the app . So this manual process requires a lot of time and if we want to do it syntactically as for different cloud providers we would have to learn different syntax/templates i.e for Azure we have ARM , for aws we have Cloud formation template and for Google cloud we have Deployment Manager and many more . And it becomes impossible to remember everything as a normal human. So, Hashicorp created terraform that is a infrastructure management tool which uses a declarative syntax. We define the resource we want to create in hashicorp language and this language throught the help of API is converted into the end required template hcl to ARM,hcl to CFT etc.
